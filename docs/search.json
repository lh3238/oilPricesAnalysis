    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe data for the project can be drawn from the OPEC Annual Statistical Bulletin (ASB), available on the OPEC website. They are collected and compiled by OPEC, an intergovernmental organization of oil-exporting countries. The data in the ASB reflect the combined efforts of OPEC and its member countries in gathering and validating oil and energy-related data.\nThe Summary section includes facts and figures about OPEC members and their crude oil production allocations. The Macro-economics section has data on population, GDP, exports, and imports of OPEC members. The Oil data: upstream section contains information on crude oil reserves, active rigs, wells completed, and oil production. The Oil data: downstream section contains refinery capacities, throughput, petroleum products output, and oil demand. The Oil trade section has data on crude oil and petroleum products exports and imports. The Oil transportation section contains information on average spot freight rates, dirty tanker spot freight rates, and clean tanker spot freight rates. The Oil prices section includes data on OPEC Reference Basket prices, various spot crude oil prices, average forward month prices, and petroleum product spot prices in major markets. The Taxes on oil section contains information on composite barrel components and tax ratios in OECD countries, along with household energy prices in Europe. The Natural gas data section provides details on natural gas reserves, production, exports, imports, and demand by country.\nWhile the specific update frequency is not stated, the ASB is typically published annually, providing yearly data. The data dimensions vary depending on the table, including country-specific details, global aggregates, and category-specific breakdowns.\nOne potential issue with the data could be the time lag in reporting and updating, given its annual publication. Also, the accuracy of the data depends on the reliability of the reporting by member countries.\nThe data are available in various tables, which can be downloaded as a zip archive from the OPEC ASB website. They can be imported by downloading the relevant tables in the provided format (likely Excel or CSV) and then processing them using R."
